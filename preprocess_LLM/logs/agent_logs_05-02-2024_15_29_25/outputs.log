description: The image is a simple, flat-design graphic of a dog's face. It's a stylized representation with basic shapes and minimal detail. The dog has a brown coat with darker brown patches over the eyes and ears, and a white stripe running down the center of its face. It also has a black nose and a little pink tongue poking out from the bottom of the smiling mouth. The background is a light pink circle, and below the image, there's the word "dog."
